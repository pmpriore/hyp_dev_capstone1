# hyp_dev_capstone1
This basic Python program, developed as a practical task in my software engineering bootcamp at Hyperion Dev, allows the user to calculate either their interest on an investment or the amount that should be repaid on a home loan each month. It aims to implement the use of variables, various data types, and if-elif-else statements.
